                        <p style="font-size: 25px">Pilar Bellosillo García-Verde was born in Madrid, Spain</p>
                        <p class="texto">
                            Born into a deeply Christian family, she was the second of eight siblings. She could remember
                            the family meetings in her grandparents' house in Derroñadas, Spain, when her life was
                            marked by the company of the family and the encounter with nature. In this environment she
                            also matured her Christian faith, to which she gives witness with her life in countless
                            writings.

                        <h3>University studies</h3>
                        <p>She studied Education at the Veritas Academy of the Teresian Institution (1931-1935),
                            where she met Father Poveda. She received a human and Christian formation that was
                            decisive in her life.<br><br>
                            She also studied Social Work at the School of Family and Social Training.

                        <h3>Her first years in Catholic Action</h3>
                        <p>She began working as a volunteer at the Academy for Women Workers run by Catholic
                            Action in Spain. In 1938, in the middle of the Spanish Civil War, she attended a course for
                            youth leaders in Saragossa, which was momentous; from then on, she committed herself
                            definitively to Catholic Action, where she held national posts all her life.
                        <br><br>
                        Her family moved to Madrid, where Pilar lived, except for long periods of time when she had
                        to live in Paris or Rome due to her international responsibilities.
                        </p>

                    <div class="cronoL" style="grid-row: 4">
                        <h3>Her commitment to Catholic Action</h3>
                        <p>She joined Catholic Action at a very young age: <q>Our Spirituality was soon nourished by very rich
                            sources: the Gospel, the Spanish mystics, Teresa of Ávila, John of the Cross...</q>.
                            <br><br>
                            She was soon elected National President of the Catholic Action Youth (1940-1946) and later
                            became National President of the Women's Branch of Catholic Action (1951-1963).
                            <br><br>
                            Her years in charge were the most active and fruitful years of Catholic Action. She
                            surrounded herself with good teams, and during these years the following plans were created:
                        </p>
                        
                        <div class="showhide" id="sh" style="max-height: 0px;">

                                <li><p>Plan of Formation on the Personality of Women (1953-1957), to provide a solution to the
                                    situation of women. It also set up the Centres of Popular Culture, very innovative and
                                    advanced centres to provide women with education and training for social, cultural, civic and
                                    political life, in addition to religious life. The aim was to provide integral formation.
                                </p></li>
                                <li><p>Another of the great actions promoted by Pilar was the so-called Impact Week, a short
                                    workshop for social formation which totally renewed the women of Catholic Action (1958).
                                </p></li>
                                <li><p>The third great Catholic action she carried out was to launch for the first time the
                                    Campaign against Hunger, today called Manos Unidas, which was a commitment to the Third
                                    World. The campaigns were carried out with such rigour, dedication and transparency that
                                    they were soon well known in Spanish society (1960).

                            </ul>
                            <p>These three actions had a great impact all over Spain.

                            In virtue of her contribution and experience in Spain, Pilar Bellosillo made her way into
                            international life when she was elected President of the World Union of Catholic Women's
                            Organisations (WUCWO) in 1961, a position she held until 1974. At that time WUCWO had
                            36 million members: 36 million Catholic women in 61 countries on five continents.

                        <h3>For the freedom of women</h3>
                        <p>It was a historical moment characterised by the beginning of women's awareness of their
                            situation of marginalisation, discrimination and often exclusion. Pilar defined it this way:<br>
                            <q>
                                We, women, are the protagonists of that historical moment, characterised by the awakening of
                                female consciousness in the world (1950-1970). It is the moment of our “liberation”. And for this,
                                WUCWO provides us with remarkable, providential possibilities!
                            </q>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            WUCWO, with Pilar as President, responded to this compelling challenge. As early as the
                            post-conciliar period in 1966, a major survey on “Women&#39;s Freedom in the Family, Society
                            and Church” was launched and sent to all WUCWO member organisations to be answered
                            by the 36 million Catholic women affiliated.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The responses carried a very representative value, because of the high participation and
                            pluralism: women of all races, different cultures and customs, and from various social and
                            economic classes. “The responses - said Pilar - revealed surprising realities and situations”.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This made WUCWO very aware, so much so that it developed a plan of action aimed at
                            improving these inhuman situations. Colloquiums, conferences, research, study meetings,
                            consultations with experts, and many more effective initiatives took place.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As a result of this work and research, WUCWO established the lines of a humanist feminism.

                        <p>
                            In 1970, at the Assembly in Torhout, Belgium, she studied and drew up, with all the
                            organisations, a great plan for education as a process of liberation, with the theme <q><b>The
                            Education of Women</b></q>. The plan was intended for the next four years, focusing an active,
                            participatory methodology that would give women the opportunity to contribute their own
                            ideas, their vision of the themes to be studied and their own criteria on the issues to be dealt with.

                        <h3>Her work against injustice and marginalisation</h3>
                        <p>
                            Another commitment that Pilar personally assumed and promoted in WUCWO was to
                            broaden the organisation's mission and work for the peoples of the Third World, for the
                            peoples in underdevelopment countries suffering from hunger and poverty: peoples who
                            suffer injustice, marginalisation and are oppressed by the powerful.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            An important step was the organisation of the Statutory Assembly and the Study Days to be
                            held in Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania, in 1974. It was the first time outside Europe, and the theme
                            was <q>WUCWO, an agent for change for a more just society</q>. More than 500 African women
                            attended this Assembly, which was a very enriching moment for them and also for those
                            from Western culture.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The next Assembly was held in Bangalore, India, in 1979 with the theme “Women, Justice,
                            Evangelisation”. Mother Teresa of Calcutta was present and gave a lecture at this Assembly.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Pilar remained President until 1974. Till the last day, she left her mark, helped by other
                            women, some of them Spanish: for the benefit of women and WUCWO as a whole, she
                            brought dynamism, vitality and a project for change, which were so much needed at the time.

                        <p>
                            As President of WUCWO, Pilar was appointed by Pope Paul VI as Auditor to the Second
                            Vatican Council, along with 22 other women. Pilar was the only Spanish laywoman. This was
                            the first time in the history of the Church. Pilar joined the Commission in charge of drawing
                            up the 13th outline for the preparation of the Pastoral Constitution “Gaudium et spes”,
                            which would be the pastoral constitution on the Church in the modern world.

                            Pilar Bellosillo tells how she lived the Council: “I lived it âvitally'. I launched into the
                            adventure of following the Spirit, of letting myself be led by Him; fully convinced that it was
                            the time for the Church to advance, it was necessary to go deeper. I was very clear about
                            that. During the intense activity of the Council, I spent sleepless nights and discovered how,
                            âworked by the Spirit', the flow we received was being ordered. This sometimes required me
                            to give up something in order to welcome the ânew'. Sometimes it was a matter of ordering it
                            with a new hierarchy of values. The astonishment of discovering the marvellous clarity and
                            coherence of God&#39;s work is indescribable. The light, the joy, the balance, the order, the peace
                            and a renewed love are the fruits produced by the possessed truth. It was clear that the
                            Church was being challenged by a lot of new questions that were being posed to the
                            conscience of the baptised. And giving the same answers led to nothing”.

                            After the conclusion of the Council, there was a colloquium with four women auditors. Each
                            one was asked a specific question. Pilar was asked what was the contribution of women to
                            the work of the Council. Pilar replied that her main concern had been to avoid any
                            discrimination against women.

                <p>
                    Pilar said: “Everything I have experienced in the Church has been a permanent source of
                    riches for me. When I was very young, I discovered that my faith is not a privilege just for me,
                    but a grace that I must share. I am in the Church not only to benefit from it, but to put myself
                    at its service”.
                </p><p>
                    Pilar was a woman of the Church, an apostle by commitment, a lay Christian by vocation. <b>She was a prophet of the 20th century.</b>
                </p><p>
                    Pilar has left us the moment when she made the commitment to dedicate herself to the
                    apostolate: “The Spanish Civil War was a very hard experience for those of us who lived it.
                    When it was over there was much to rebuild; in that moment I made the commitment to
                    dedicate myself to the apostolate. A commitment that will last my whole life. It is the
                    beginning of my personal and exciting adventure that is not yet over”.
                </p><p>
                    Since she was young, Pilar dedicated her life and apostolic passion to fight for the promotion
                    of women, for their dignity and above all for their freedom. Her apostolate was not
                    something routine, superficial... She loved the “others” and she expressed it this way: “My
                    great vocation is being outlined progressively; it will be that of being at the service of the
                    others, at the service of their fulfilment as persons and as Christians. To be at the service of
                    God&#39;s design in the world... to take charge of the history of God&#39;s cause. This is the
                    extraordinary vocation of the Christian”.
                </p><p>
                    She lived her deep faith, her dedication and fidelity to the Church and her love for Jesus
                    Christ as a lay woman. Pilar said: “It was not a matter of entering a religious institute, that
                    was not my vocation; my vocation was to live my baptism, which is the “source” of this
                    wonderful life. Through baptism I have entered the family of God. Nothing can be added to
                    this “greatness”. I have entered his Church. Little by little this vocation to be a “lay Christian”
                    will be “enlightened”.
                </p><p>
                    Pilar was a prophet because, inspired by the Spirit and strengthened by her faith, she
                    transmitted the message of Jesus Christ and her own religious experiences with spontaneity
                    and conviction. A prophet because she was a pioneer woman, ahead of her time. Also, she
                    was a prophet because she brought conversion, renewal and progress into the Church, and
                    she wanted to open windows so that “fresh air” could enter, as John XXIII said.
                </p><p>
                    Pilar said: “I am aware that I have made a long journey, always going forward, and I can
                    identify Jesus Christ in my own âExodus' to the land of freedom, dignity and justice”.
                </p><p>
                    Pilar was a very advanced woman in her time. Throughout her life she actively participated in
                    the construction of a better world, in the promotion of women and in the renewal of the
                    Church. She was an engine of change and progress in society and in the Church, a model to
                    imitate and an example to follow.
